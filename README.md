# Releases
----------
2016.01.19.
First readme...
So, the gradle build is almost up and running. However the assets are separately distributed as of now. 

To build the project please execute:
gradle build copyRuntimeLibs

This will put all resources into the /build/libs/lib folder, except assets.jar, which is separately distributed.
Please add that manually from a release until to the /build/libs/lib folder. The assets most probably will load separately in the future.
